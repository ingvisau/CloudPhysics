# Cloud Physics

## *Cloud Thermodynamics*

*Clouds are mixtures of vapor, dry air and water/ice. The atmosphere is approximately an ideal gas.*


**Daltons law**: $P=\Sigma p_i$
For each gas $i$, the ideal gas law applies:
$P=p_d + e =nRT$ , 
$n-$ number of moles per unit volume. $n=n_d + n_v$
$p_d-$ partial pressure, dry air
$e-$ partial pressure, vapor

**Mole fraction:** $y_i=\frac{n_i}{n}=\frac{p_i}{p}$ 

**Specific Humidity**
A mass-based expression for the amount of water vapor in the air.

$$q_v=\frac{\rho_v}{\rho_{air}}\approx\epsilon y_v
$$

where $\epsilon=M_v/M_d=0.622$ is the ration of molar masses of water and dry air, and $n_d=n-n_v$.

**Mixing ratio:** $r_v=\frac{\rho_v}{\rho_d}=\frac{q_v}{1-q_v}$

Expressing the equation of state in an alternative, mass-based way:

$$p=\rho_{air}R_d(1+q_v(\frac{1-\epsilon}{\epsilon}))T=\rho_{air}R_dT_v
$$

where $T_v$ is the virtual temperature, and $R_d(=R/M_d)$ is the dry-air gas constant.

#### Adiabatic Isobaric Processes
Many atmospheric processes are well approximated by the adiabatic (q=0) and isobaric (dp/dt=0) reference process, for example:
* Mixing of two air parcels
* Evaporation of rain drops at a fixed height.

The enthalpy $h=u + pv$ is conserved for such process.
:::warning
Recall that:
$\begin{align}
dh &= du+dpv(=0)+pdv\\
&=du+pdv = c_vdT+RdT\\
&=(c_v+R)dT=c_pdT
\end{align}$

:point_right: $dh$ corresponds to the heat required to increase the temperature of a material with $dT$ at constant pressure.
:::

**Multiphase system of dry air, vapor and liquid**
$h=y_dh_d+y_vh_v+y_lh_l$
$\frac{dh}{dt}=0$
 
$y_ddh_d+y_vdh_v+y_ldh_l+h_ddy_d+h_vdy_v+h_ldy_l=0$ **(1)**


No change in amount of dry air => $dy_d$=$0$ ,
Changed amount of liquid water must come from vapor, and vice versa => $dy_v$=$-dy_l$

From yellow box: $dh_d=C_{p,d}dT$ , $dh_l=C_{p,l}dT$

Inserted in **(1)**:
$dh=y_dC_{p,d}dT+d(y_v(h_v-h_l))+(y_v+y_l)c_ldT$

$h_v-h_l=l_v$ : *latent heat of vaporization*
$y_v+y_l=y_w$

:arrow_down: 

$(y_dc_{p,d}+y_wc_l)dT=-d(l_vy_v)$  **(2)**

***Define:*** 
Specific heat of the cloud system: $[c_p]_{cloudsystem}=y_wc_l+y_dc_{p,d}$

We can  now use ***(2)*** to define *wet bulb temperature*:

$$\int_{T}^{T_{wb}}c_pdT=-\int_{y_v}^{y_{vs}}d(l_vy_v)
$$ 
$y_{vs} -$ mole fraction of water vapor at saturation

:arrow_down: 

$c_p(T_{wb}-T)=-l_v(y_{vs}(T_{wb})-y_v)=-l_v(\frac{e_s}{p}(T_{wb})-\frac{e}{p})$

$T_{wb}=T-\frac{l_v}{c_pp}(e_s(T_{wb})-e)$

**Wet Bulb Temperature:** The temperature you get by evaporating water until saturation is reached.

**Equivalent temperature:** If we instead integrate **(2)** from $T$ to $T_e$, and $y_v$ to $0$, we get $T_e$, which is the temperature we would get if all water would condense out (thereby releasing latent heat to the air).

:::info

**$T_v-$ Virtual Temperature:** 
*The temperature a dry air parcel must have to have the same density as a moist air parcel.*
$$T_v=(1+q_v(\frac{1}{\epsilon}-1)\approx (1+0.61q_v)T
$$
$T_v > T$, because most air is lighter than dry air, so a dry air parcel needs to be warmed up to obtain the same density as the moist air parcel.

**$T_{wb}-$ Wet Bulb Temperature:**
The temperature you get by evaporating water until saturation is reached.

**$T_e-$ Equivalent Temperature**
Condensing all vapor, temperature increase give $T_e$.
$$T_e=T+y_v\frac{l_v}{c_p}=T+e\frac{l_v}{c_pp}
$$

**$T_d-$ Dew Point Temperature**
The temperature reached by cooling moist air to saturation, holding $p$ and $r_v constant.$

## *Cloud Microphysics*
*How doÂ cloud particles form, grow and interact with each other?*

> Clouds are the places in the atmosphere where water changes phase. Water vapor enters a cloud and is converted, by one mechanism or another, into liquid and/or solid phases of water. Nucleation is the process by witch these condenced phases are initiated.

## Nucleation

* *"Kjernedannelse"*
* There is an energy barrier to the formation of cloud particles (drops and ice crystals) because the new phase has lower entropy

:::info
$\Delta\phi = \phi_V-\phi_L =\frac{l_v}{T}$
:arrow_down:
$\phi_L-\phi_V=-\frac{l_v}{T}$
:::

HOWEVER, if the thermodynamic driver, supersaturation, is large enough, the phase transition will take place anyway!

### Formation of cloud drops (liquid phase)
::: success
Homogenous nucleation can be disregarded in the atmosphere.
:::

:::info
**Embryo:** The critical embryo, or germ, is a molecular cluster having critical radius $r_d^*$, where the free energy $\Delta G_h$ has its maximum value. The germ sits on the cusp between evaporation and growth, so it exists in a state of equilibrium with its environment. (see p. 282)
:::
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1bsU1Yrh.png)
* Fig. 7.4 illustrates the critical droplet size and its relation to clusters, equilibria, embryos and nucleation.
* Imagine...
    * A volume of air with water vapor, with pressure lower than necessary for nucleation.
    * Random merging of water vapor molecules to embryos, but with too low binding energy to be sustained.
* Formation of embryos: a random spontaneous process. Must employ the theory of statistical quantum mechanics to explain the process
    * Use of micro-thermodynamics also reveal correct results... Here we use Gibbs free energy (not pensum in this chapter).

### Effect of substrate to lower the energy barrier:
#### Insoluble surface 

The presence of the insoluble surface aids the nucleation of liquid by lowering the free energy to form liquid at any given saturation ratio.

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BywEdktr3.png)
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByiOuJYSn.png)
* Fig 7.9: Contact angle for hydrophilic, neutral and hydrophobic particles VS. saturation ratio.
    * Hydrophobic: $\theta$ ~ $150-180^\circ, S_{th}$ ~ $4.3$
    * Neutral: $\theta$ ~ $90^\circ, S_{th}$ ~ $2-3$
    * Hydrophilic: $\theta$ ~ $0-30^\circ, S_{th}$ ~ $1$


#### Nucleation on an insoluble particle
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJxhqJtHn.png)

Spherical cap of liquid forms on the curved surface of the particle, which acts as a discrete nucleating agent.
* Large particles that are easily wettable (have small $\theta$) serve as better condensation nuclei than do particles composed of hydrophobic substances (which have larger $\theta$)

#### Formation of liquid on a soluble particle
An aerosol particle composed of water-soluble matter (e.g. inorganic salts) can initiate the liquid phase much more effectively than an insoluble particle can.
* Water breaks the ionic bonds of a salt, which otherwise require high temperature to melt.
* The dissolved salt lowers the equilibrium pressure.
* **Deliquescence:** dissolving a solid particle into a liquid solution.
    * Occurs at RH < 100%
    * Water molecules accumulate faster than they leave.
    * The solute ions in effect act as molecular anchors by retarding the evaporation of water molecules.
    * Approximated as an equilibrium process: solid > liquid incrases entropy --> It is not nucleation!
        * Nevertheless, atmospheric particles, because they aid the formation of liquid from water vapor, are CN.
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hy7eKxYSh.png)

* Fig. 7.11: A particle of NaNO~3~ was exposed to air at different relative humidities and allowed to come to equilibrium and its mass *m* measured relative to that in the dry state, *m~0~*. At humidities below the onset of deliquescence, water vapor adsorbs (hold as film on surface) onto the dry surface, but the amount of water is insufficient to disrupt the crystalline lattice. The water molecules stay on the surface for a while, but then desorb with little effect on the solid. As the humidity rises, the concentration of adsorbed molecules increases, and the accumulated water is eventually sufficient to dissolve the salt. At the deliquescence-point (S~deliq~)the non-linear process of dissolution takes place: The adsorbed water breaks some of the ionic bonds holding the salt together and removes the ions from the solid. These ions that are sequestered (isolated) in the liquid covering the particle hinder the evaporation of the water molecules. The lowered vapor pressure (from the solute effect, as described by Raoult's law) leads to further uptake of water molecules from the vapor phase and new opportunities for further dissolution of the solid. The process of vapor uptake continues until the solid completely disappears and all the ions become part of the liquid solution droplet
    * (NH~4~)~2~ Ammonium sulfate (fully neutralized form of sulfuric acid): $S_{deliq}$=0.79
    * H~2~SO~4~ Pure sulfuric acid: always liquid, just the relative proportions of water and sulfate vary with the humidity.
    * Growth after deliquescence: hygroscopic growth.
    * Hygroscopic growth factor: $GF=\frac{D_p(s)}{D_p(0)}=1 + \frac{A_{hyg}S}{1-S}$

* Fig. 7.14: $S_{bulk deliquescence} < S_{particle deliquescence}$

### Formation of the solid phase
Ice can in principle form from the vapor phase by either of two pathways:
* **Direct pathway:** Water vapor to particle (deposition) is only possible if an ice nuclei (IN) exists.
* **Indirect pathway:** First condensation to water, then freezing. Homogenous nucleation of liquid phase is possible, i.e. without IN.
    * Energy barrier to the transition from liquid to solid: Large super cooling $\Delta T_s = T_0-T,$ $T_0=0^{\circ}$ is needed.
    * $\Delta T$ has a direct relationship to change in chemical potential (generalized form of Gibbs free energy)
        * $\Delta \mu = \mu_L-\mu_S=RT*ln\frac{e_s}{e_i}=l_f\frac{\Delta T_s}{T_0}$

#### Theory of homogenous freezing -- find the treshold temperature for freezing to occur
*We want to calculate the change in system free energy to form a microscopic embryo of the new phase (ice)in the parent phase (a droplet of supercooled water).*
1) Calculate the free energy to form embryos in the new phase.
    * Consider a microscopic embryo (hexagonal prism)of ice within a droplet. Area of hexagonal prism is larger than a sphere by a factor $\alpha$, and volume factor $\beta$.
        * $V_i=\frac{4}{3} \pi r_iÂ³*\alpha$, $r_i$-- inscribed sphere
        * $A_i=4\pi r_iÂ²*\beta
    * Change in system free energy to form embryo:
    $\Delta G_i=$-- volume contribution + surface contribution
    $=V_i n_i \Delta \mu +A_i*\sigma_{IL}$
    $=-\frac{4}{3} \pi r_iÂ³ \alpha n_i l_f \frac{\Delta T_s}{T_0} + 4 \pi r_iÂ² \beta \sigma_{IL}$
    $n_i-$molar density of ice, $\sigma_{IL}-$interfacial energy between solid and liquid
2) Determine the critical point - the free energy must overcome.
    * $\frac{\delta}{\delta r_i}(\Delta G_i)=0$ --> Gives maximum value of $\Delta G_i$; $\Delta G_i^*$
        * Find expression for $r_i^*$, and put into $\Delta G_i$ =>
    * $\Delta G_i^* = \frac{16\pi \sigma_{IL}Â³\xi}{3(n_il_f\frac{\Delta T_s}{T_0})Â²}$, 
        * ($\xi =\frac{\beta Â³}{\alpha Â²}-$Net geometrical factor accounting for "non-sphere" geometry.)
    * :exclamation: :
        * $\Delta T$ large ->  lower energy barrier.
        * Small $\xi$ (area/volume) -> lower free energy barrier
        * Very sensitive tpo $\sigma_{IL}$, which is difficult to determine.
3) Calculate the rate of nucleation, frequency of new molecules added to the embryo.
    * This applies to the formation of ***one*** embryo, but what is the rate at which molecules are added to the critical embryo per unit volume?
    * $J_i=J_1n(r_i^*)$, volumetric nucleation rate.
    $J_1-$ The rate at which ***one*** critical embryo acquires molecules from the liquid $(sâ»Â¹)$
    $n(r_i^*)-$ The number of critical embryos (germs) $(mâ»Â³)$
    * How do we determine J?
        * The mechanism by which new water molecules build into the ice embryo differs from nucleation from the water phase for which the supply of water is limiting. The limiting factor here is the ability of the molecules to leave the liquid and enter the ice.
        * Nota that: in contrast to the nucleation of liquid droplets from vapor phase, the nucleation of ice in supercooled water involves two energy barriers:
            * The activation energy $\Delta g_{act}$: The ability of water molecules to leave the liquid, and enter solid state. The molecules in the liquid are already bonded together, and these bonds need to be broken before the molecules can form new "ice"-bonds. The energy "bump" (see fig. 7.18).
5) Estimate the treshold conditions.


#### Effect of solute (dissolved salt) on freezing (haze)

* Water activity: $a_w=\frac{n_w}{n_w+in_s}$

:::info
**Activity**
High a~w~ -> More dilute solution, and more likely that ice forms
Low a~w~ -> More salt and less likely for ice to form (few "isolated" pockets of water)
:::

* The small size of haze droplets reduces the probability of ice to form (higher supercooling needed)
* *Note: Solute has strong attachments to water molecules, which HINDER the water molecules to arrange into ice lattice structures*

#### Heterogenous nucleation of ice
* Observations show that ice particles are found in clouds for temperatures well above the treshold for homogenous freezing 
--> Ice Nuclei (IN) must be present.

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJ9TtzMLn.png)

* Fig. 7.23: 
    * Solute lowers the freezing and melting point
    * IN increases the $T_f = T_{f, het}$
    * Freezing (both homogenous and heterogenous) is stochastic processes.
* **Ice Nuclei:**
    *  Insoluble
    * Crystalline structure similar to the hexagonal lattice of ice.
    * Nucleation takes place on the surface of the particles.
    * Concentrations: IN ~ 1/L, CCN ~ 10âµ/L
    * Silver Iodide (AgI) $T_f$ ~ $-4^\circ C$
    * Not all good IN have ice-like crystalline structures.
* Different ice-forming mechanisms:
    * **Deposition nucleation:** The particle causes a transition from vapor to ice at S < 1 < S_i.
    * **Contact nucleation:** Freezing of supercooled drops upon contact with IN, Brownian diffusion.
    * **Condensation freezing:** An IN coated with salts (sulfate) may first serve as CCN then later as IN, when the drop is sufficiently diluted.
    * **Immersion freezing:** Mineral particle, with some hygroscopicity, but not soluble, enters the drop, and then freezes when sufficient $\Delta T_s$



## Growth from the vapor

We have cloud particles, via aerosol activation or nucleation. How rapidly and by what mechanism do the particles grow?

**Growth by:**
* Vapor phase increase molecule by molecule.
* Collection of other particles (Ch.9).

:::info
**Remember**

$S\equiv\frac{e_\infty}{e_s(T_\infty)}=s+1 ,$ (saturation ratio)

$e_\infty -$ vapor pressure in the interstitial air.
$e_s(T_\infty) -$ equilibrium vapor pressure over plane surface.

$s\equiv\frac{e_\infty}{e_s(T_\infty)}-1 ,$ (Supersaturation)


**KÃ¶hler function**
Reference supersaturation accounting for solution and curvature.

$s_K=\frac{e_{eq}}{e_s}-1$

$e_{eq}-$ equilibrium vapor pressure of the solution droplet.

When the particle is ice, then $e_eq$ and $e_s$ are replaced by equilibrium vapor pressure of ice, $e_i$ to obtain the supersaturation with respect to ice: $s_i\equiv e_\infty/e_i - 1$

The relative driving factor for the vapor growth of a cloud droplet is the supersaturation difference:

$s-s_K=\frac{e_\infty - e_{eq}}{e_s(T_\infty)}$
:::

**Growth by vapor proceeds in three steps:**
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkzydSz8h.png)

1) Mass transport from afar (many radii distance away)
2) Surface processes: Removal of vapor by condensation, Gradients in capor, Latent heat release and warming adjacent to particle, Gradients in temperature.
3) Energy transport, Transport of heat away from the particle.

#### STEP 1. -- Mass transport onto the particle 

$I_v-$ Total flow of vapor toward the particle (mol/s).

$\frac{dm_p}{dt}= -M_vI_v,$

$M_v-$ molecular mass of water
Positive direction defined as outward from the particle.

The net flux at any point follows ***Fick's first law***:
$$\Phi=-D_v\Delta n
$$

$D_v-$ diffusivity
$n-$ molar concentration, $n=\frac{e}{RT}$

:arrow_down: 

Vapor flow into the particle is the integrated flux of vapor across the particle surface:
$$ \frac{dm_p}{dt}=-M_v \oint\Phi_{v,surf}dA
$$

--> Applies to a particle of any shape.


***Spherical liquid drops -- Maxwell's theory***
Air is treated as a continuum up to the droplet surface, uniform flux of water toward the drop.

*Skip some steps...*

Maxwell's mass growth law:

$$ \frac{dm_d}{dt}=4 \pi r_d \rho_L G*(s-s_K)
$$
$G-$ constant that takes into account diffusivity(D) and latent heat.

The mass of a droplet varies with the radius --> "Linear growth law":
$$r_d\frac{dr_d}{dt}=G*(s-s_K)
$$

:::success
***Notice:***

* $\frac{dm_d}{dt} \propto r_d$ 

    --> Total mass is aquired most rapidly by larger droplets.
    
* $\frac{dr_d}{dt} \propto \frac{1}{r_d}$  

    --> Condensation favor the smaller drops, which lead to a narrowing of droplet size distribution.
:::

:exclamation: See lecture 13 for refinements of the theory

#### From the book
* A new phase can form only if that new phase is thermodynamically favored.
    * From 3.2: The molar free energy (chemical potential) of water in the new (daughter) phase must be lower than that of the original (parent) phase for the new phase to have a chance of surviving --> then the parent phase is *metastable* wrt the daughter phase (the molecules will be at a lower potential energy once the new phase has formed).
    * Problem with condenced phase from vapor: entropy is lowered. Entropy does not decrease easily in nature, so metastable phases (e.g. supercooled cloud water) can persist for long times
    * --> A new phase of lower energy can form, however, if the thermodynamic driver (chemical potential difference) is sufficiently large.
* Ways of forming a new phase (of a single compound, e.g. water):
    * **Homogenous nucleation:** uniform parent phase, no external agent.
    * **Heterogenous nucleation:** multiple phases, external agent involved.
* Four steps to calculate conditions under which the new phase is likely to form:
    * a) Calculate the free energy to form embryos of the new phase. 
        * Volume and surface contributions to changes in the system free energy --> Result is an equation expressing the free energy change as a function of embryo size and the magnitude of the thermodynamic driver (chemical potential difference)
    * b) Determine the critical point.
        * Determine the embryo size at which the function from a) attains it maximum value --> critical embryo. The free energy to form the critical embryo is the barrier to make the new phase stable.
    * c) Calculate the rate of nucleation.
        * Thermodynamics of embryo formation + kinetics --> frequency with which molecules are added to the critical embryo. Vary greatly with thermodynamic driver.
    * d) Estimate the threshold conditions.
        * " The onset of nucleation is established by choosing a nucleation rate that the user deems significant, then finding the environmental conditions, expressed in terms of the applicable thermodynamic driver, that give that rate."
